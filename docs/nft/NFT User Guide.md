# YieldLoop NFT User Guide  
**BNB Chain | Utility NFTs**

This guide explains the YieldLoop NFTs in plain language:  
what they are, what they do, what they **do not** do, and how to decide whether they are right for you.

YieldLoop NFTs are **optional utility memberships**.  
You do **not** need an NFT to use YieldLoop.

---

## 1) What these NFTs are (and are not)

YieldLoop NFTs are **utility-only digital memberships**.

They exist to provide:
- **Protocol-fee discounts** inside YieldLoop
- **Optional access** to community and advisory channels
- A structured **advisory / think-tank participation framework** (Governor role)

They do **not** provide:
- Ownership, equity, or shares in YieldLoop
- Revenue share, dividends, or profit rights
- Guaranteed performance, yield, or appreciation
- Strategy priority or execution advantages
- DAO governance authority or treasury control

If you are buying an NFT, you should do so **only for the utility benefits**, not as an investment.

---

## 2) NFT types

### 2.1 Supporter NFT (public)

**What it is**
- A publicly mintable utility NFT

**What you get**
- **5% protocol-fee discount**
- Optional access to Supporter community areas

**What you do NOT get**
- Ownership, profit share, yield, or guarantees
- Influence over strategy or execution

**Transferability**
- Supporter NFTs are freely transferable like standard NFTs.

---

### 2.2 Governor NFT (team-bestowed, advisory role)

- A role NFT bestowed by the YieldLoop team
- Not publicly sold by default

**Revocation**
- Governor status may be revoked if necessary (e.g., misconduct, misrepresentation, loss of trust)

---

## 2.3 Pricing (Supporter NFT)

- Target mint price: **$300 USD equivalent**
- Paid in **BNB**, using the prevailing on-chain conversion rate at the time of mint
- Price is **configurable** and may change over time
- Price changes apply only to future mints

The mint price reflects **access and utility only** and should not be interpreted as a statement of resale value or future worth.

Protocol fees, discount structures, and platform economics may change over time, and discounts are not guaranteed to persist indefinitely.

---

## 3) Who these NFTs are for (and not for)

### These NFTs may be appropriate for:
- Users who plan to use YieldLoop long-term and value protocol-fee discounts
- Community members who want optional access and visibility
- Contributors interested in advisory participation (Governor, by invitation)

### These NFTs are **not** appropriate for:
- Short-term speculators
- Anyone seeking guaranteed returns
- Anyone expecting ownership or governance rights
- Anyone uncomfortable with blockchain risk or irreversible transactions

If this does not describe you, you should **not** mint.

---

## 4) How discounts work (simple explanation)

Discounts apply **only** to the YieldLoop **protocol fee**.

They do **not** apply to:
- Gas fees
- DEX fees
- Slippage
- Market losses
- Strategy outcomes

**Discount priority**
- Governor NFT → **10%**
- Supporter NFT → **5%**
- No NFT → **0%**

**Example**
If the YieldLoop protocol fee for a cycle is 20% of verified profits:
- A Supporter receives a 5% reduction on that protocol fee
- A Governor receives a 10% reduction on that protocol fee

Discounts do not affect how trades are executed or which strategies are used.

---

## 5) Before you mint (important)

Minting an NFT is an **irreversible blockchain transaction**.

This means:
- **No refunds**
- Transactions cannot be reversed
- Network (gas) fees apply
- Wallet security is your responsibility

Only mint from official YieldLoop links.  
YieldLoop will **never** ask for your seed phrase.

---

## 6) How to mint a Supporter NFT

1. Open the official **Supporter Mint dApp**
2. Connect your wallet (MetaMask or WalletConnect)
3. Confirm you are on **BNB Chain**
4. Select quantity
5. Review total cost (mint price + gas)
6. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
7. Wait for confirmation
8. Verify the NFT appears in your wallet or “My NFTs” page

Mint proceeds are routed to the YieldLoop team/dev multisig for development and operations.

---

## 7) Governor “Think Tank” sessions

YieldLoop may periodically host structured advisory sessions (“think tank sessions”). 
Think tank sessions may occur infrequently or not at all, at the sole discretion of the YieldLoop team.

These sessions:
- Are purpose-defined and limited in size
- Provide structured, non-binding advisory input
- Do **not** constitute governance, employment, or contracting

### 7.1 Bounties (optional and bounded)

Some sessions may include a predefined bounty pool:
- Assigned **before** the session begins
- Seats are limited
- Bounty is split equally among verified participants who meet session requirements

### 7.2 Cool-down rule

To encourage broad participation:
- Any Governor who receives a bounty becomes **ineligible for the immediately subsequent session**

### 7.3 No entitlement

Think tank bounties:
- Are discretionary
- Are not guaranteed
- Do not accrue
- Do not create ongoing compensation relationships

Participation in one or more sessions does not imply ongoing expectations, recurring opportunities, or future consideration of any kind.

## 8) Security best practices

- Never share your seed phrase
- Use a hardware wallet if possible
- Bookmark official YieldLoop URLs
- Beware of impersonators and fake mints
- Verify contract addresses before signing

YieldLoop cannot recover lost wallets or compromised keys.

---

## 9) Taxes and record keeping

NFT purchases and transfers may have tax implications depending on your jurisdiction.

YieldLoop:
- Does not provide tax advice
- Does not track user tax obligations
- Does not file reports on your behalf

You are responsible for maintaining your own records and complying with applicable laws.
