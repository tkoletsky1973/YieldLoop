# Appendix UX — Application Architecture & Interaction Rules  
## YieldLoop Frontend Specification

**Author:** Todd Koletsky  
**Date:** January 1, 2026  
**Version:** v0.5.1  

---

## Document Purpose

This appendix defines the **authoritative user interface architecture** for YieldLoop.

Its role is to ensure that the frontend:
- reflects **protocol truth exactly**
- does **not imply yield, continuity, or guarantees**
- does **not obscure inactivity, loss, or non-execution**
- provides **explicit interpretive context** without projection
- prevents discretionary control or narrative distortion

This document is **binding** for frontend design and implementation.

If a frontend element contradicts this appendix, the frontend is incorrect.

## UX-1 — Core UX Principles and Boundaries

### UX-1.1 Purpose of the Frontend

The YieldLoop frontend exists to:
- present **on-chain state and protocol-defined outcomes**
- allow **explicit user configuration and authorization**
- display **finalized results after settlement**
- explain system states **without implying performance**

The frontend does **not** exist to:
- persuade participation
- optimize user behavior
- project outcomes
- soften risk
- simulate activity

The frontend is a **truth surface**, not a sales surface.

---

### UX-1.2 Separation of Truth and Interpretation

YieldLoop distinguishes between two classes of information:

1. **Protocol Truth**
   - vault state
   - cycle state
   - execution events
   - settlement outputs
   - accounting recognition
   - balances and inventory

2. **Interpretive Context**
   - explanations of what a state means
   - explanations of what did *not* occur
   - clarification of why inactivity or halting is valid
   - clarification of how outcomes are classified

The frontend:
- MAY provide interpretive context
- MUST NOT provide inference, projection, or expectation
- MUST NOT frame outcomes as success or failure

Explanation is permitted.  
Implication is forbidden.

---

### UX-1.3 Non-Negotiable UX Invariants

The YieldLoop frontend MUST enforce the following invariants at all times:

1. No live profit indicators  
2. No rolling or intra-cycle PnL  
3. No APY, ROI, projections, or expectations  
4. No implied execution continuity  
5. No mid-cycle configuration or control  
6. No mark-to-market valuation  
7. No default aggregation across vaults  
8. No redemption guarantees  
9. No execution guarantees  
10. No emergency or override UI  

These constraints apply:
- across all screens
- across all user roles
- across all system states

They are **architectural**, not cosmetic.

---

### UX-1.4 User Responsibility Boundary

The frontend MUST clearly enforce the responsibility boundary:

- Users are responsible for:
  - strategy selection
  - parameter bounds
  - capital allocation
  - execution cost funding
  - cycle authorization

- The system is responsible for:
  - deterministic execution within bounds
  - conservative halting
  - honest settlement
  - final accounting

Once a cycle is authorized:
- user control ends
- interpretation remains available
- intervention is not

---

### UX-1.5 Inactivity and Non-Execution Are Valid States

The frontend MUST treat the following as **first-class, valid outcomes**:

- no execution during a cycle
- partial execution
- halted strategies
- zero-profit cycles
- loss cycles
- inventory carryover
- paused redemption

These states:
- MUST be displayed explicitly
- MUST be explained neutrally
- MUST NOT be framed as errors or failures

YieldLoop is allowed to do nothing.
The frontend must make that legible.

---

### UX-1.6 Finality Over Continuity

The frontend MUST reinforce that:

- cycles are discrete
- settlement is final
- outcomes are not revised
- history is immutable

There is:
- no rewind
- no retry
- no smoothing
- no reinterpretation after settlement

Finality is a feature, not a defect.

---

**End of UX-1**

## UX-2 — Global Application Structure

### UX-2.1 Structural Purpose

The global application structure exists to:
- enforce **separation of concerns**
- prevent narrative blending between execution, accounting, and governance
- make protocol boundaries visible through navigation
- eliminate implied continuity or performance through layout

Navigation structure is a **governance tool**, not a convenience feature.

---

### UX-2.2 Required Top-Level Sections

The YieldLoop frontend MUST expose the following top-level sections:

1. **Overview**
2. **Vaults**
3. **Cycles**
4. **Execution**
5. **Inventory**
6. **Settlement**
7. **LOOP**
8. **Governance / Supporter**
9. **Documentation**
10. **Settings**

No section may be removed, renamed, or merged.

---

### UX-2.3 Section Responsibility Boundaries

Each section has a **single, non-overlapping responsibility**.

- **Overview**
  - situational awareness only
  - no execution detail
  - no performance implication

- **Vaults**
  - vault state and configuration
  - authorization status
  - withdrawal availability

- **Cycles**
  - global cycle timing
  - enrollment windows
  - cycle identifiers and status

- **Execution**
  - execution event history
  - execution attempts, skips, and halts
  - neutral event logs only

- **Inventory**
  - unrealized positions
  - carryover state
  - no valuation or PnL

- **Settlement**
  - finalized cycle results
  - accounting recognition
  - immutable historical record

- **LOOP**
  - LOOP balance
  - redemption status
  - accounting parity explanation

- **Governance / Supporter**
  - supporter contributions
  - governance participation
  - non-execution capital only

- **Documentation**
  - whitepaper
  - appendices
  - protocol disclosures

- **Settings**
  - preferences
  - notifications
  - display controls (non-financial only)

Responsibilities MUST NOT overlap.
If data belongs to another section, it must not appear.

---

### UX-2.4 Navigation Rules

- Navigation MUST NOT imply flow, progress, or hierarchy
- No section may be styled as “primary” or “active” based on outcomes
- No badges, counts, or indicators implying success or failure
- Navigation order MUST remain static across sessions and users

The interface must not suggest that users are “moving forward” toward profit.

---

### UX-2.5 Cross-Section Data Visibility

Data MAY be referenced across sections only if:
- the data is **read-only**
- the data is **explicitly labeled**
- the user is directed to the authoritative section for context

Example:
> “See Settlement for finalized results.”

Cross-section duplication is forbidden.

---

### UX-2.6 Prohibited Structural Patterns

The frontend MUST NOT include:
- dashboards combining execution + profit
- timelines implying growth or momentum
- collapsible sections that hide loss or inactivity
- summaries that aggregate outcomes across vaults by default

Aggregation, if allowed, must be:
- user-initiated
- opt-in
- clearly labeled as non-authoritative

---

### UX-2.7 Structural Enforcement Rule

If a layout:
- blurs accounting and execution
- implies continuity across cycles
- visually rewards activity
- obscures inactivity or loss

It is **non-compliant** with YieldLoop.

---

**End of UX-2**

---

## UX-3 — Overview Screen

### UX-3.1 Purpose of the Overview

The Overview exists to provide **orientation**, not performance.

It answers:
- Where am I in the system?
- What cycle state exists?
- What am I currently committed to?

It does **not** answer:
- How am I doing?
- Is the system working?
- Did I make money?

---

### UX-3.2 Global Cycle Status (Required)

The Overview MUST display:

- **Current Cycle ID**
- **Cycle Status**
  - Not Started
  - Executing
  - Settled
- **Cycle Timing**
  - Start timestamp (UTC)
  - End timestamp (UTC)
  - Time Remaining (calendar time only)

Required static banner:
> YieldLoop operates on fixed calendar cycles.  
> Execution may occur at any time or not at all.

No execution counters, progress bars, or activity indicators are permitted.

---

### UX-3.3 User Participation Summary

The Overview MUST display:

- **Vaults Authorized for Current Cycle:** <integer>
- **Withdrawals:** {Enabled | Locked}

If withdrawals are locked, display:
> Funds are locked by protocol rule until settlement completes.

No vault balances or performance data may appear here.

---

### UX-3.4 Last Settled Cycle Summary

The Overview MUST display the most recent **completed** cycle only.

Display order is mandatory:

1. **Accounting Recognition**
   - Verified Net Profit: {YES | NO}

2. **User Outcome**
   - Outcome: {Gain | Flat | Loss}

3. **Inventory Status**
   - Inventory Remaining: {YES | NO}

4. **LOOP Minted**
   - Amount or 0

Required explanation block:
> Accounting recognition governs fees and LOOP minting.  
> User outcome reflects realized balance change after settlement.

No historical charts or comparisons permitted.

---

### UX-3.5 Absence of Current-Cycle Feedback

During an active cycle, the Overview MUST NOT display:
- execution progress
- number of trades
- inferred activity
- estimated results
- “working” indicators

If a cycle is Executing, the UI MUST be visually neutral.

---

### UX-3.6 Overview Copy Rules

Language MUST:
- describe state, not performance
- describe rules, not expectations
- describe outcomes only after settlement

Language MUST NOT:
- imply effort
- imply likelihood
- imply success or failure
- imply competence or optimization

---

### UX-3.7 Overview Enforcement Clause

If the Overview:
- reassures users mid-cycle
- signals momentum
- suggests evaluation quality
- implies future outcomes

It violates YieldLoop UX rules.

---

**End of UX-3**

## UX-4 — Vault Interface

### UX-4.1 Purpose of the Vault Interface

The Vault interface is the **primary user control boundary** in YieldLoop.

It exists to:
- allow users to configure and authorize execution **before a cycle**
- display vault state **during and after a cycle**
- present finalized outcomes **after settlement**
- enforce isolation between user capital units

The Vault interface does **not** exist to:
- present performance narratives
- imply strategy quality
- suggest optimization
- allow discretionary intervention

Each vault is a **self-contained execution and accounting unit**.

---

### UX-4.2 Vault Isolation (Non-Negotiable)

Each vault MUST be:
- rendered independently
- visually and structurally isolated
- incapable of interacting with other vaults through the UI

The frontend MUST NOT:
- pool balances across vaults
- average outcomes
- summarize vaults into a single “portfolio” view by default

If aggregation is offered:
- it MUST be opt-in
- it MUST be explicitly labeled as non-authoritative
- it MUST NOT be the default view

Isolation is a trust boundary, not a UX preference.

---

### UX-4.3 Canonical Vault States

Each vault MUST exist in exactly one of the following states per cycle:

1. **Idle**
   - funds deposited
   - no strategy configured
   - withdrawals fully enabled

2. **Configured**
   - strategies selected
   - parameters defined
   - no authorization granted
   - withdrawals fully enabled

3. **Authorized**
   - configuration approved
   - Execution Cost Wallet funded
   - withdrawals disabled
   - awaiting cycle start

4. **Executing**
   - cycle active
   - strategies may execute within bounds
   - funds locked
   - no user or system intervention

5. **Settled**
   - execution complete
   - settlement finalized
   - withdrawals enabled

State transitions are:
- one-directional per cycle
- deterministic
- irreversible

---

### UX-4.4 Vault Detail Tabs (Required)

Each vault detail view MUST expose the following tabs:

1. **Status**
2. **Configuration**
3. **Execution**
4. **Inventory**
5. **Settlement History**
6. **Execution Cost Wallet (ECW)**

Tabs MUST:
- remain visible across all states
- be disabled (not hidden) when not applicable
- never imply progress or completion

---

### UX-4.5 Status Tab

The Status tab MUST display:

- Vault Identifier
- Current Vault State
- Associated Cycle ID
- Withdrawals: {Enabled | Disabled}

If withdrawals are disabled, display:

> Funds are locked by protocol rule until settlement completes.

No balances, performance indicators, or execution metrics may appear here.

---

### UX-4.6 Configuration Tab

#### UX-4.6.1 Configuration Visibility Rules

The Configuration tab:
- MUST be editable only in **Idle** or **Configured** states
- MUST become read-only in **Authorized**, **Executing**, and **Settled** states

Read-only state MUST be visually explicit.

---

#### UX-4.6.2 Displayed Configuration Elements

The Configuration tab MUST display:

- selected strategy engines
- parameter bounds per strategy
- capital allocation per strategy
- selected profit handling mode
- Execution Cost Wallet funding level
- authorization timestamp (if authorized)

All values MUST be presented as **final inputs**, not tunable suggestions.

---

#### UX-4.6.3 No Optimization Language

The Configuration tab MUST NOT include:
- sliders implying optimization
- language implying improvement or efficiency
- ranking or scoring of strategies
- expected outcomes or probabilities

Configuration is **constraint definition**, not strategy tuning.

---

### UX-4.7 Authorization Boundary

Authorization is the **final point of user control** for a cycle.

Once authorization occurs:
- configuration locks
- withdrawals disable
- AI assistance disables
- user control ends

This boundary MUST be visually and textually explicit.

---

### UX-4.8 Authorization Screen (Critical)

The Authorization screen MUST require explicit acknowledgment of all of the following:

- Funds will be locked for the duration of the cycle
- Execution may not occur
- Profit is not guaranteed
- Loss is possible
- Settlement is final

Each acknowledgment MUST be individually affirmed.

---

#### UX-4.8.1 Authorization Action

The authorization action button MUST:

- be labeled exactly: **Authorize Next Cycle**
- require deliberate interaction
- be disabled until all acknowledgments are complete

No alternative wording is permitted.

---

### UX-4.9 Execution Tab (Within Vault)

The Execution tab:
- MUST mirror the global Execution view
- MUST display only events relevant to the vault
- MUST be read-only

Execution MUST be displayed as a **neutral event log**, including:

- strategy evaluated
- execution attempted
- execution skipped
- execution halted
- trade executed
- trade closed

No charts, colors, or performance cues are permitted.

---

### UX-4.10 Inventory Tab (Within Vault)

The Inventory tab MUST:

- list all unrealized positions
- display origin cycle
- display open/closed status
- display asset type only

The Inventory tab MUST NOT display:
- market value
- unrealized PnL
- projected recovery

Required banner:
> Inventory represents unrealized exposure and is excluded from profit recognition.

---

### UX-4.11 Settlement History Tab

The Settlement History tab MUST display:

- cycle identifier
- accounting recognition (YES / NO)
- user outcome (Gain / Flat / Loss)
- inventory remaining (YES / NO)
- LOOP minted (amount or 0)

Historical entries are immutable.

No comparisons, trends, or summaries permitted.

---

### UX-4.12 Execution Cost Wallet (ECW) Tab

The ECW tab MUST display:

- current ECW balance
- minimum required balance
- ECW deductions by cycle

ECW MUST be visually separated from principal.

Low-balance conditions MAY trigger warnings but MUST NOT:
- imply execution will continue
- imply urgency or fear
- imply system responsibility

---

### UX-4.13 Vault Interface Enforcement Clause

If the Vault interface:
- allows mid-cycle change
- implies strategy quality
- suggests performance expectation
- masks inactivity or loss
- aggregates vault outcomes by default

It is **non-compliant** with YieldLoop.

---

**End of UX-4**

## UX-5 — Configuration Flow (Pre-Cycle Only)

### UX-5.1 Purpose of the Configuration Flow

The configuration flow exists to:
- allow users to define **explicit, bounded execution intent**
- surface all risk and constraints **before commitment**
- convert configuration into a **binding commitment** at authorization

The configuration flow does **not** exist to:
- guide users toward profit
- optimize strategies
- encourage participation
- imply likelihood of success

Configuration is **risk declaration**, not performance selection.

---

### UX-5.2 Configuration Availability Rules

Configuration MAY occur only when a vault is in one of the following states:
- Idle
- Configured

Configuration MUST NOT be available when a vault is:
- Authorized
- Executing
- Settled

Any attempt to modify configuration outside permitted states MUST be blocked.

---

### UX-5.3 Strategy Selection

#### UX-5.3.1 Strategy Presentation Rules

Strategies MUST be presented as:
- discrete cards
- equal visual weight
- neutral ordering

Strategy cards MUST include:
- strategy name
- permitted execution scope
- high-level constraints

Strategy cards MUST NOT include:
- expected returns
- success rates
- performance history
- ranking or scoring
- recommendations unless explicitly AI-labeled

---

#### UX-5.3.2 Strategy Disclaimers

Each strategy selection view MUST include the following disclaimer:

> Strategy execution is conditional.  
> Execution may be partial, minimal, or not occur at all.

---

### UX-5.4 Parameter Definition

#### UX-5.4.1 Parameter Entry Rules

Parameters MUST:
- be entered as hard bounds
- enforce protocol-defined limits
- reject invalid or unsafe combinations

Parameters MUST NOT:
- imply optimization
- auto-adjust dynamically
- suggest ideal values

---

#### UX-5.4.2 Parameter Disclaimers

Each parameter section MUST include:

> Parameters define execution limits, not expected outcomes.

---

### UX-5.5 Capital Allocation

Capital allocation MUST:
- be explicit
- total no more than 100%
- be validated before authorization

Allocation UI MUST NOT:
- imply diversification benefit
- imply risk reduction
- auto-balance or normalize values

---

### UX-5.6 Profit Handling Mode Selection

The configuration flow MUST present exactly the following options:

1. Compound All  
2. Split 50 / 50  
3. Withdraw All Profits  

Each option MUST include the following statement:

> Applied only at settlement and only if verified profit exists.

No additional profit modes may be presented.

---

### UX-5.7 Execution Cost Wallet (ECW) Funding

#### UX-5.7.1 ECW Separation

The ECW MUST be:
- visually separated from principal
- labeled as execution funding only

---

#### UX-5.7.2 ECW Display Requirements

The ECW section MUST display:
- current ECW balance
- minimum required balance
- explanation of execution halting on exhaustion

Required explanation text:

> Execution halts if ECW funds are exhausted.  
> No borrowing or subsidies occur.

---

### UX-5.8 Authorization Transition

The configuration flow MUST culminate in the Authorization screen.

No configuration action may persist unless:
- explicitly reviewed
- explicitly acknowledged
- explicitly authorized

Configuration without authorization does not create commitment.

---

### UX-5.9 Configuration Flow Enforcement Clause

If the configuration flow:
- implies strategy quality
- suggests expected performance
- nudges user behavior
- auto-optimizes inputs

It violates YieldLoop UX rules.

---

**End of UX-5**

---

## UX-6 — Execution View

### UX-6.1 Purpose of the Execution View

The Execution view exists to:
- display **what execution actions occurred**
- display **what execution actions did not occur**
- provide an auditable, neutral event record

It does **not** exist to:
- reassure users
- demonstrate effort
- imply competence
- suggest future outcomes

---

### UX-6.2 Execution Display Rules

The Execution view MUST:

- contain NO charts
- contain NO progress indicators
- contain NO profit or loss indicators

Neutral presentation is mandatory.

---

### UX-6.3 Execution Event Log

Execution MUST be rendered as a chronological event log.

Permitted event types include:
- Strategy evaluated
- Execution conditions unmet
- Execution skipped
- Trade executed
- Trade closed
- Strategy halted

Events MUST:
- be timestamped
- use neutral language
- avoid qualitative judgment

---

### UX-6.4 Non-Execution Visibility

If no execution occurs during a cycle, the Execution view MUST explicitly state:

> No execution occurred during this cycle.

This state MUST NOT be hidden or softened.

---

### UX-6.5 Execution View Enforcement Clause

If the Execution view:
- implies continuous activity
- masks inactivity
- reassures users mid-cycle

It is non-compliant.

---

**End of UX-6**

---

## UX-7 — Inventory Interface

### UX-7.1 Purpose of the Inventory Interface

The Inventory interface exists to:
- display unrealized exposure
- distinguish inventory from profit
- prevent misclassification of outcomes

Inventory is neither success nor failure.

---

### UX-7.2 Inventory Display Requirements

The Inventory interface MUST display:
- asset identifier
- originating cycle
- open / closed status
- custody location (vault)

---

### UX-7.3 Prohibited Inventory Data

---

### UX-7.5 Inventory Persistence Rules

Inventory MUST:
- persist across cycles without modification
- remain idle unless explicitly reauthorized
- not generate LOOP
- not influence fees

---

### UX-7.6 Inventory Interface Enforcement Clause

If the Inventory interface:
- implies future recovery
- suggests pending profit
- treats inventory as temporary failure

It violates YieldLoop UX rules.

---

**End of UX-7**

- prevent reinterpretation of history

Settlement is **not a report**.  
It is a **final record**.

---

### UX-8.2 Settlement Timing Rules

The Settlement interface MUST display data only for:
- completed cycles
- finalized settlement events

No settlement data may appear before settlement completes.

---

### UX-8.3 Required Settlement Fields

For each settled cycle, the interface MUST display:

- Cycle Identifier
- Settlement Timestamp (UTC)

> Results are final and not revised.

---

### UX-8.5 No Post-Settlement Interaction

The Settlement interface MUST NOT:
- allow user action
- allow appeals or retries
- allow reclassification of outcomes
- allow export that alters interpretation

Settlement is immutable.

---

### UX-8.6 Settlement Interface Enforcement Clause

If the Settlement interface:
- suggests outcomes are provisional

It violates YieldLoop UX rules.

---

**End of UX-8**

---

## UX-9 — LOOP Interface

### UX-9.1 Purpose of the LOOP Interface

The LOOP interface exists to:
- display LOOP balances
- explain LOOP’s accounting nature
- present redemption status transparently

It does **not** exist to:
- promote LOOP as yield
- imply entitlement
- guarantee redemption timing

---

### UX-9.2 LOOP Balance Display

The interface MUST display:

- LOOP Balance
- Accounting Parity: 1 LOOP = 1 USDT
- Redeemable Now
- Queued

---

### UX-9.3 Required LOOP Disclaimer

The following banner MUST be displayed prominently:

> LOOP is an accounting receipt of retained surplus.  
> Redemption is capacity-limited and not guaranteed in timing.

---

### UX-9.4 Redemption Interface Rules

The redemption interface MUST display:

- Requested Amount
- Redemption Status: {Available | Queued | Paused}
- Queue Epoch Identifier

The interface MUST NOT display:
- countdown timers
- estimated wait times
- priority indicators

---

### UX-9.5 LOOP Interface Enforcement Clause

If the LOOP interface:

The following disclaimer MUST be displayed:

> Supporter contributions are not execution capital.  
> They are not redeemable.  
> They do not participate in profit.

---

### UX-10.4 Governance Interaction Rules

Governance interfaces MUST:
- affect only future cycles
- never modify past outcomes
- never imply execution control

---

### UX-10.5 Governance Interface Enforcement Clause

If governance UI:
- implies discretionary execution power
- blurs supporter and vault capital
- suggests profit participation

It violates YieldLoop UX rules.

---

### UX-12.2 Failure State Rules

Failure states MUST:
- be displayed explicitly
- be explained neutrally
- include no apology
- include no remediation promise

---

### UX-12.3 Edge Condition Enforcement Clause

If the UI:
- hides failure
- reframes loss
- implies recovery

It violates YieldLoop UX rules.

---

**End of UX-12**

---

## UX-13 — UX Enforcement Clause

### UX-13.1 Binding Authority

This appendix overrides:
- convenience
- aesthetics
- marketing pressure
- growth incentives

---

### UX-13.2 Non-Compliance Definition

Any frontend element that:
- implies profit
- implies execution certainty
- allows mid-cycle interaction
- masks inactivity or loss
- rewrites interpretive boundaries

Is **non-compliant with YieldLoop**.

---

### UX-13.3 Final Statement

YieldLoop does not protect users from risk.  
It protects users from **lies**.

The frontend must do the same.
