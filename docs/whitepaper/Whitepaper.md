# YieldLoop

## A User-Authorized Execution and Settlement System

**Whitepaper 12_15_25**  
**Version:** 0.1  
**Status:** Initial Design Specification  

YieldLoop is software infrastructure that enables users to authorize predefined actions on their own digital assets and records the outcomes of those actions after execution has completed.

The system is non-custodial, cycle-based, and rule-driven.  
It does not take custody of assets, pool funds, predict outcomes, or provide financial advice.

YieldLoop exists to execute what users explicitly authorize — and to account for what actually happens.
