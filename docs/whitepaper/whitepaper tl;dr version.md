# YieldLoop — DeFi, Finished Properly  
**Quick Read (TL;DR)**  
For people who are done pretending unfinished trades are “returns.”

---

## The One-Liner

**YieldLoop is a cycle-based DeFi system that only records profit when it’s real, finalized, and auditable — and refuses to fake anything when it isn’t.**

No APYs.  
No projections.  
No emissions.  

Just completed cycles and settled truth.

---

## Why This Exists (And Why It’s Different)

Most DeFi platforms don’t actually know when a trade is finished.

They show:
- Assumed yield  
- Rolling balances  
- Incentives masking losses  
- Dashboards that look good until they don’t  

YieldLoop was built around one rule:

> **Nothing counts until the cycle ends.**

That single rule changes everything.

---

## What Actually Happens

YieldLoop runs **fixed execution cycles** inside **user-owned, non-custodial vaults**.

Each cycle:
- Starts only with explicit user authorization  
- Executes predefined strategies within hard limits  
- Ends at a known time  
- Settles once  
- Produces a final, unchangeable result  

At settlement, the math is brutal and simple:

End Balance
– Start Balance
– Gas
– Protocol Costs

Two outcomes exist:
- **Positive** → It was real  
- **Zero or negative** → Treated as zero  

No smoothing.  
No carryover.  
No re-labeling later.

Every cycle ends.  
Every result stands.

## Where the Edge Comes From

YieldLoop doesn’t chase yield.

It survives long enough for yield to matter **when it’s actually available**.

- Flat markets? It goes quiet.  
- Bad conditions? It records zero.  
- Good conditions? It locks in what’s real.  

That restraint is the advantage.

## “Set It, Forget It” — Without Blind Trust

Users:
1. Connect a wallet  
2. Deposit into their own vault  
3. Define limits and strategies  
4. Authorize a cycle  
5. Walk away  

During execution:
- Funds are locked  
- Nothing can be changed  
- No live P&L feeds emotions  

After settlement:
- Withdraw  
- Compound  
- Or run another cycle  

No babysitting.  
No constant decisions.  
No false signals.

## LOOP & The Floor (The Part People Miss)

LOOP is not a reward token.

It is **proof that surplus already happened**.

- Minted only after real profit exists  
- No emissions  
- No pre-mint  
- No inflation without value  

The system intentionally mints LOOP *slower* than surplus accumulates when conditions allow.

That creates a strengthening internal accounting ratio over time — sometimes referred to as the **floor**.

Not a promise.  
Not price support.  
Just math, applied after reality.

---

## Why This Doesn’t Collapse

YieldLoop does **not** require:
- New users  
- Constant volume  
- Rising prices  
- Emissions  

If nothing works, the system idles.

That’s not weakness.  
That’s how it avoids lying to survive.

---

## Risks (Stated Up Front)

- Losses are possible  
- Zero-result cycles are normal  
- Markets can stay unproductive  
- External protocols can fail  

YieldLoop doesn’t soften this.

It’s designed to **tell the truth clearly**, not to comfort you.

---

## Who This Is Actually For

YieldLoop is for people who:
- Are tired of chasing APYs  
- Want final answers, not rolling stories  
- Prefer discipline over excitement  
- Understand that patience is a position  

It is not for:
- Guaranteed return seekers  
- Yield gamblers  
- Anyone who needs constant action  

---

## The Point

YieldLoop isn’t trying to impress you.

It’s trying to **end trades cleanly, record what’s real, and still be here when the noise is gone**.

If that sparks curiosity, the whitepaper shows exactly how it works.

If not, this system will happily ignore you.

---

**Nothing happens until a cycle ends.  
Nothing is recorded unless it’s real.  
That’s the line.**
