# YieldLoop — Plain-English Overview (Read This First)

**Audience:** DeFi novices and burned-out traders who want discipline, finality, and truth — not promises.  
**What this is:** A factual overview for people who will bounce quickly.

---

## 0) One-Sentence Definition

YieldLoop is a **cycle-based, non-custodial execution system** that **records profit only when it is finalized and provable**, and does nothing when it is not.

No projections. No assumptions. No smoothing.

---

## 1) The Problem (What Keeps Breaking Everywhere Else)

Most “yield” platforms fail for one simple reason:

They **treat expectations as results**.

This usually shows up as:
- advertised APYs that aren’t final
- incentives that mask losses
- trades that never truly end
- rolling dashboards instead of settlement
- systems that require constant growth to survive

When reality diverges, the definition of “success” quietly changes.

YieldLoop was built to prevent that.

---

## 2) What YieldLoop Is (Mechanically)

YieldLoop is:

- **Non-custodial** — assets stay in your vault
- **Cycle-based** — execution happens only inside fixed windows
- **User-authorized** — nothing runs without your explicit approval
- **Fail-closed** — when something breaks, execution stops and settlement begins
- **Final** — results settle once and do not change

The system is designed to remain valid during:
- flat markets
- down markets
- slow periods
- extended zero-result phases

Survival does not depend on growth.

---

## 3) What YieldLoop Is NOT (Hard Boundaries)

YieldLoop is not:

- a guaranteed return product
- an APY engine
- a passive income promise
- a managed trading service
- a system that intervenes mid-cycle
- a platform that redefines losses as “temporary”

If you are looking for certainty or monthly expectations, this system will frustrate you.

That is intentional.

---

## 4) “Set and Forget” — What That Actually Means Here

### The Actual User Flow

1. Connect wallet  
2. Open your personal vault  
3. Deposit assets (idle until execution)  
4. Configure allowed actions and limits  
5. Authorize a fixed execution cycle  
6. Walk away  
7. Cycle ends → settlement runs  
8. Final results are shown  
9. You withdraw, compound, or reauthorize  

### What You Don’t Do

- No chart watching  
- No mid-cycle changes  
- No reacting to noise  
- No babysitting positions  

You define the rules once.  
The system tells you the truth at the end.

---

## 5) The One Rule That Defines Everything

### Nothing counts until the cycle ends.

YieldLoop does not treat mark-to-market movement as profit.

At settlement, the system compares:

- starting balance  
- ending balance  
- minus real execution costs  

Only two outcomes exist:

- **Net profit > 0** → it is real and recorded  
- **Net profit ≤ 0** → it is treated as zero  

No partial credit.  
No carryover assumptions.  
No smoothing.

---

## 6) About APYs and Promises

Other platforms promise APY because their numbers are never final.

YieldLoop does not promise.

Instead, it makes this commitment:

- **If profit is real and finalized, it will be reported.**
- **If it is not, it will not be dressed up.**

Same reality everyone operates in.  
Different level of honesty.

---

## 7) LOOP and the “Floor” (Read Carefully)

LOOP is **not** a reward, incentive, or growth mechanism.

It exists for one reason only:
> To record **verified surplus that already happened**.

### About the Accounting Floor

YieldLoop does not target, manage, defend, or optimize a floor.

The internal accounting floor is:
- not a goal
- not a KPI
- not a promise
- not a growth objective
- not a market signal

It is a **mechanical ratio**:

verified retained surplus ÷ LOOP supply

If execution performs well **over time**, that ratio *may* strengthen.

If execution does not, it won’t.

This behavior was **not the design goal**.
It is a **side effect of refusing to mint or assume value that doesn’t exist**.

The system would still be functioning correctly if the floor:
- never rises
- flattens for years
- moves irregularly
- stops changing entirely

YieldLoop does not chase APY.
When profit exists repeatedly, APY narratives tend to chase it.

---

## 8) Risk (Stated Without Sugar)

Loss is possible.
Zero-result cycles are normal.
Flat periods are expected.
External protocols can fail.
There is no insurance and no guarantee.

YieldLoop does not protect you from loss.

It protects you from **fiction**.

---

## 9) Who This Is Actually For

### DeFi Novices
- want clear boundaries
- accept that loss is possible
- prefer final results over constant noise
- do not want to babysit trades

### Burned-Out Traders
- tired of chasing yield
- tired of incentives masking truth
- tired of emotional micromanagement
- want discipline, finality, and closure

If you need optimism to stay engaged, this system is not for you.

---

## 10) The Real Difference

Most platforms optimize for:
- engagement
- excitement
- growth narratives

YieldLoop optimizes for:
- finality
- auditability
- survivability
- truth

It is intentionally boring.

Boring systems tend to still exist when exciting ones don’t.

---

## 11) If You Remember One Thing

YieldLoop does not promise returns.

It promises this:

- **Real profit will be recorded when it exists.**
- **No profit will be invented when it doesn’t.**

Everything else is a consequence of that rule.
