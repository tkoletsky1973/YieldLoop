# YieldLoop — Project Status

_Last updated: December 2025_

This document provides a clear snapshot of where the YieldLoop project stands today, what is complete, and what remains to be built.

It is intended for developers, auditors, grant reviewers, and collaborators.

---

## 1) Project Phase

**Current phase:**  
Specification complete / pre-MVP implementation

YieldLoop is not yet deployed. The core architecture, rules, and constraints have been fully specified and documented prior to implementation.

This is intentional.

---

## 2) What Is Complete

The following components are fully defined in documentation:

### Core Platform
- Proof-driven yield model
- Cycle-based execution logic
- Verified surplus accounting
- Non-inflationary design philosophy

### NFT Program
- Two-tier utility NFT system (Supporter / Governor)
- Pricing, minting, transfer, and revocation rules
- On-chain discount enforcement model
- Admin controls and safety mechanisms
- Public mint dApp specification
- Admin panel specification

### Governance & Advisory
- Clear separation of advisory vs binding governance
- Governor role definition
- Multisig control model
- Explicit bounty funding source (marketing budget, 0.5%–1%)

### Documentation
- Whitepaper (draft)
- Appendix B — NFT Program
- Appendix H — Governance & Advisory
- Developer-facing NFT documentation

---

## 3) What Is NOT Yet Built

The following items are **not implemented yet**:

### Smart Contracts
- Supporter NFT contract
- Governor NFT contract
- DiscountRegistry contract
- YieldLoop core protocol contracts

### Frontend Applications
- Public Supporter mint dApp
- NFT admin panel
- YieldLoop user dashboard

### Security
- Formal audit
- Threat modeling
- Testnet deployment

---

## 4) What Is Explicitly Out of Scope (for now)

- DAO governance
- Automated bounty distribution
- Token emissions or inflationary rewards
- NFT staking or yield mechanics
- Cross-chain deployments
- KYC or identity systems

---

## 5) What the Project Is Seeking

At this stage, YieldLoop is seeking:

- Smart contract developers (BNB / EVM)
- Frontend developers (React / Next.js)
- Security auditors
- Grant opportunities
- Technical advisors

Implementation will proceed once development resources are secured.

---

## 6) How to Get Oriented Quickly

If you are new to the project:

1. Read `README.md`
2. Read the whitepaper in `docs/whitepaper/`
3. Read:
   - `docs/appendices/APPENDIX_B_NFT_PROGRAM.md`
   - `docs/appendices/APPENDIX_H_GOVERNANCE_ADVISORY.md`
4. Read `docs/nft/NFT_DEV_BRIEF.md`

You will then have full context.

**YieldLoop is built to prove reality first — then scale.**
