# Appendix H — Governance and Advisory Framework

## H.1 Purpose and Intent

This appendix defines the **governance and advisory framework** for the YieldLoop platform.

At launch, YieldLoop is **not a DAO** and does **not** grant binding governance authority to token holders or NFT holders. Decision-making authority is intentionally centralized within the YieldLoop team and its multisig to ensure operational safety, accountability, and regulatory clarity.

This framework exists to:
- Enable structured **advisory input**
- Recognize trusted contributors
- Prevent implied ownership, oversight, or fiduciary authority
- Allow future governance evolution without promising it

---

## H.2 Governance Philosophy

YieldLoop governance prioritizes:
- System safety
- Execution reliability
- Clear accountability
- Resistance to premature decentralization

Accordingly:
- Final authority remains with the YieldLoop team
- Treasury and privileged actions are controlled by multisig
- Advisory participation is encouraged but **non-binding**

No governance rights are implied by token or NFT ownership.

---

## H.3 Advisory vs Binding Governance

### H.3.1 Advisory Participation

Advisory participation includes:
- Feedback and critique
- Strategy discussion
- Risk analysis
- Educational content
- Onboarding and community support
- Partnership and outreach assistance

Advisory participation does **not** include:
- Control of funds
- Voting power
- Enforcement authority
- Execution rights
- Fiduciary responsibility

---

### H.3.2 Binding Governance

Binding governance involves enforceable authority over:
- Protocol rules
- Treasury funds
- Contract upgrades
- Administrative enforcement

At launch, **no external participants** hold binding governance authority over YieldLoop.

---

## H.4 The Governor Advisory Role

### H.4.1 Definition

The **Governor** role is a high-trust **advisory and support position** within the YieldLoop ecosystem.

Governors are invited contributors who assist the platform through:
- Strategic input
- Design critique
- Education and onboarding
- Partnerships and outreach
- Community support

Governors do not control the platform.

---

### H.4.2 Eligibility and Invitation

Governor status is **bestowed by the YieldLoop team** and is not obtained through public purchase by default.

Eligibility may include, but is not limited to:
- Active and constructive community participation
- Educational or onboarding contributions
- Strategic partnerships
- Influencer or ecosystem support
- Advisory or subject-matter expertise

Invitation criteria are discretionary and may evolve over time.

---

### H.4.3 Authority and Limitations

Governors:
- Hold **no ownership or equity**
- Have **no binding decision-making power**
- Do **not** control treasury or protocol execution
- Serve in an advisory and support capacity only

No Governor has unilateral authority.

---

## H.5 Relationship to the Governor NFT

Governor participation is represented by a **Governor NFT**, which functions as:
- A role identifier
- An access credential
- A signaling mechanism

The Governor NFT:
- Is non-transferable by default
- May be revoked and burned by administrative action
- Does not grant voting rights or ownership
- Does not create an entitlement to compensation

Holding a Governor NFT alone does not guarantee continued participation or benefits.

---

## H.6 Participation Expectations

Governor participation is **voluntary** and **non-contractual**.

Participation may include:
- Strategy discussion
- Risk review
- Educational content
- Community and onboarding support
- Partnership development

No minimum participation level is guaranteed or required unless separately agreed.

---

## H.7 Governor Support Bounty Program

### H.7.1 Purpose

To encourage meaningful participation, YieldLoop may provide **discretionary support bounties** to Governors who actively contribute to the platform.

These bounties are intended as **operational support and recognition**, not yield, profit participation, or compensation.

---

### H.7.2 Explicit Funding Source (Marketing Budget)

The Governor support bounty pool is funded **exclusively from the platform’s marketing budget**.

Specifically:
- A configurable **0.5%–1.0% of the total marketing budget** is allocated to the Governor support pool
- The marketing budget itself is funded through the platform’s existing protocol profit split
- No additional token issuance, emissions, or inflation mechanisms are created

This is a **budget allocation**, not a new revenue stream.

---

### H.7.3 Asset and Distribution

- Bounties are paid in **LOOP**
- Distribution is **manual and discretionary**
- Payments are executed by the YieldLoop team multisig
- Timing, frequency, and amount vary based on contribution and available budget

---

### H.7.4 No Entitlement or Guarantee

Governor support bounties:
- Are not automatic
- Are not guaranteed
- Are not owed
- Do not constitute wages, salary, yield, or profit share

Eligibility is evaluated solely by the YieldLoop team based on observed participation.

---

## H.8 Removal and Revocation

Governor status may be removed at any time by administrative action.

Removal may occur due to:
- Inactivity
- Abuse or misconduct
- Misrepresentation
- Conflict of interest
- Violation of platform rules
- Loss of trust

Removal may include revocation and burning of the associated Governor NFT.

---

## H.9 Decision Authority

At launch:
- All binding decisions remain with the YieldLoop team
- Multisig controls treasury and privileged actions
- Advisory input does not override administrative authority

Governors influence decisions through expertise and persuasion, not votes.

---

## H.10 Future Governance Expansion (Non-Binding)

YieldLoop may, in the future:
- Introduce formal governance mechanisms
- Delegate limited authority to advisory groups
- Implement voting or DAO-like structures

Any such changes:
- Require explicit disclosure
- Are not implied by current participation
- May involve new contracts or frameworks

No future governance rights are promised or guaranteed.

---

## H.11 Legal and Operational Disclosures

This advisory and governance framework:
- Does not create employment, partnership, or fiduciary relationships
- Does not grant ownership, equity, or revenue rights
- Does not constitute an investment offering
- Does not guarantee compensation or continued participation

Participation is voluntary and subject to change.
