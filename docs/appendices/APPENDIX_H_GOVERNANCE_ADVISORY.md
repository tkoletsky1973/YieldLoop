# Appendix H — Governance and Advisory Framework

## H.1 Purpose and Intent

This appendix defines the **governance and advisory framework** for the YieldLoop platform.

At launch, YieldLoop is **not a DAO** and does **not** grant binding governance authority to token holders, NFT holders, or external participants. Decision-making authority is intentionally centralized within the YieldLoop team and its designated multisig to ensure operational safety, accountability, and regulatory clarity.

This framework exists to:
- Enable structured, bounded **advisory input**
- Recognize trusted contributors without conferring authority
- Prevent implied ownership, control, oversight, or fiduciary duty
- Support future governance evolution **without promising it**

Nothing in this appendix creates governance rights, enforceable claims, or expectations of compensation.

---

## H.2 Governance Philosophy

YieldLoop governance prioritizes:
- System safety
- Execution reliability
- Clear accountability
- Resistance to premature decentralization

Accordingly:
- Final authority remains with the YieldLoop team
- Treasury access and privileged actions are controlled by multisig
- External participation is advisory and **non-binding**

No governance rights are implied by token or NFT ownership.

---

## H.3 Advisory Participation vs. Binding Governance

### H.3.1 Advisory Participation

Advisory participation may include:
- Feedback and critique
- Strategy discussion (non-binding)
- Risk analysis and scenario review
- Design and UX review
- Educational content and onboarding support
- Partnership and outreach assistance
- Community support and moderation assistance

Advisory participation does **not** include:
- Control of funds or treasury
- Contract upgrade authority
- Enforcement authority
- Execution rights or privileged access
- Fiduciary responsibility or duty
- Authority to bind the YieldLoop team

Advisory input is considered at the sole discretion of the YieldLoop team.

---

### H.3.2 Binding Governance

Binding governance involves enforceable authority over:
- Protocol rules and parameter enforcement
- Treasury funds and disbursements
- Contract upgrades or migrations
- Administrative enforcement actions

At launch, **no external participants** hold binding governance authority over YieldLoop.

---

## H.4 The Governor Advisory Role

### H.4.1 Definition

The **Governor** role is a high-trust, non-binding **advisory and support position** within the YieldLoop ecosystem.

Governors are invited contributors who may assist the platform through:
- Strategic input and critique
- Risk review and adversarial thinking
- Education and onboarding support
- Partnerships and outreach assistance
- Community support and coordination

Governors do not control the platform and do not represent YieldLoop unless explicitly authorized in writing.

---

### H.4.2 Eligibility and Invitation

Governor status is **bestowed by the YieldLoop team** and is not obtained through public purchase by default.

Eligibility may include, but is not limited to:
- Constructive community participation
- Educational or onboarding contributions
- Demonstrated technical or operational competence
- Strategic partnerships or ecosystem support
- Advisory or subject-matter expertise

Invitation criteria are discretionary and may evolve over time.

---

### H.4.3 Authority and Limitations

Governors:
- Hold **no ownership or equity**
- Have **no binding decision-making power**
- Do not control treasury, contracts, execution, or admin actions
- Have no unilateral authority of any kind
- Do not create fiduciary, agency, or representative relationships

Governors influence decisions through expertise and persuasion only.

---

## H.5 Relationship to the Governor NFT

Governor participation is represented by a **Governor NFT**, which functions as:
- A role identifier
- An access credential (e.g., gated channels)
- A signaling mechanism within the ecosystem

The Governor NFT:
- Is non-transferable by default
- May be revoked and burned by administrative action
- Does not grant voting rights or ownership
- Does not create any entitlement to compensation, payments, or continued participation

Holding a Governor NFT alone does not guarantee benefits, invitations, or bounties.

---

## H.6 Participation Expectations

Governor participation is **voluntary**, **non-contractual**, and **non-exclusive**.

Participation may include:
- Think tank sessions (defined below)
- Strategy discussion (advisory only)
- Risk review and critique
- Educational content and onboarding support
- Community support and coordination
- Partnership development support

No minimum participation level is required unless separately agreed in writing. Lack of participation may result in reduced invitations or eventual revocation, at the team’s discretion.

---

## H.7 Think Tank Sessions and Advisory Bounties

### H.7.1 Purpose

YieldLoop may convene discrete, purpose-defined advisory sessions (“think tank sessions”) to gather structured input from Governors.

These sessions are intended as:
- Advisory input and critique
- Risk identification and structured discussion
- Non-binding preference signaling

These sessions are **not**:
- Binding governance votes
- Ownership oversight
- Compensation for services
- Employment or contractor work

---

### H.7.2 Session Definition (Pre-Assigned Bounty and Seat Limits)

Each think tank session is defined **in advance** and includes:
- A specific purpose or topic
- A fixed date and duration
- A **maximum number of seats** (determined per session)
- A **predefined bounty pool amount** assigned to the session before participation begins
- The participation requirements (e.g., attendance + confirmed vote/input)

Participation is invite-based or application-based at the YieldLoop team’s discretion.

---

### H.7.3 Funding Source (Marketing Budget Allocation)

Think tank bounty pools are funded **exclusively from the platform’s marketing budget**.

Specifically:
- A configurable **0.5%–1.0% of the total marketing budget** may be allocated for these sessions
- The marketing budget itself is funded through the platform’s existing protocol profit split
- No additional token issuance, emissions, or inflation mechanisms are created for bounties

This is a **bounded budget allocation**, not a revenue stream and not a user-funded program.

---

### H.7.4 Distribution Mechanics (Equal Split, Conditional on Verified Participation)

At the conclusion of a think tank session:
- The bounty pool is split **equally** among participants who:
  - Are verified as having attended, and
  - Complete required participation criteria (e.g., confirmed vote or documented input)

Distribution is:
- Manual and discretionary in v1
- Executed by the YieldLoop team multisig
- Paid in LOOP (or other designated token)

If a participant does not meet verification requirements, they receive no share of the bounty pool for that session.

---

### H.7.5 Cool-Down Rule (Rotation Requirement)

To prevent concentration and ensure broad participation:

- Any Governor who **receives a bounty payment** for a think tank session becomes **ineligible for the immediately subsequent think tank session**
- This cool-down applies regardless of topic or session size
- Governors who do not receive a bounty (e.g., did not attend or did not complete participation requirements) are not subject to the cool-down

The intent is to rotate participation, diversify input, and avoid recurring or implied compensation patterns.

---

### H.7.6 No Entitlement, No Guarantee, No Compensation

Think tank bounties:
- Are **not automatic**
- Are **not guaranteed**
- Are **not owed**
- Do not accrue
- Do not represent wages, salary, yield, profit share, or consideration for services
- Do not create employment, contractor, agency, partnership, or fiduciary relationships
- Do not grant future rights, priority, or standing

All invitations, eligibility determinations, and distributions remain at the sole discretion of the YieldLoop team.

---

## H.8 Removal and Revocation

Governor status may be removed at any time by administrative action.

Removal may occur due to:
- Inactivity
- Abuse or misconduct
- Misrepresentation of YieldLoop or the Governor role
- Conflict of interest
- Violation of platform rules or community standards
- Loss of trust

Removal may include revocation and burning of the associated Governor NFT and loss of gated access.

---

## H.9 Decision Authority

At launch:
- All binding decisions remain with the YieldLoop team
- The multisig controls treasury and privileged actions
- Advisory input does not override administrative authority

Governors influence decisions through expertise and persuasion, not binding votes.

---

## H.10 Future Governance Expansion (Non-Binding)

YieldLoop may, in the future:
- Introduce formal governance mechanisms
- Delegate limited authority to advisory groups
- Implement voting or DAO-like structures

Any such changes:
- Require explicit disclosure
- Are not implied by current participation
- May involve new contracts, frameworks, and eligibility requirements

No future governance rights are promised or guaranteed.

---

## H.11 Legal and Operational Disclosures

This advisory framework:
- Does not create employment, contractor, partnership, agency, or fiduciary relationships
- Does not grant ownership, equity, revenue rights, or profit rights
- Does not constitute an investment offering or solicitation
- Does not guarantee compensation, bounties, invitations, or continued participation
- May be modified or discontinued prospectively at the YieldLoop team’s discretion

Participation is voluntary and subject to change.
