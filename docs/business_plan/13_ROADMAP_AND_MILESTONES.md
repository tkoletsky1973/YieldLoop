# 13. Roadmap and Milestones

YieldLoop’s roadmap is intentionally conservative and validation-driven. Progress is measured by system correctness, safety, and sustained operation rather than speed, scale, or market visibility.

Milestones are designed to reduce risk incrementally and to ensure that each phase is independently viable before advancing.

## 13.1 Phase Definitions

### Phase 0 — Design Finalization and Documentation
- Complete and freeze core system architecture
- Finalize whitepaper and business plan documentation
- Define supported execution modules and constraints
- Establish legal posture and non-reliance disclosures

**Exit Criteria:**
- Documentation internally consistent
- System scope clearly bounded
- No unresolved architectural ambiguities

---

### Phase 1 — Initial Implementation and Internal Testing
- Implement core smart contracts and execution logic
- Deploy test environments
- Conduct internal testing and simulations
- Identify and resolve critical defects

**Exit Criteria:**
- Deterministic execution confirmed
- Authorization boundaries enforced
- Settlement and accounting operate as specified

---

### Phase 2 — Security Review and Controlled Deployment
- Conduct independent security review or audit
- Address audit findings
- Deploy system with limited availability
- Restrict supported features and integrations

**Exit Criteria:**
- No unresolved critical or high-severity issues
- Emergency safeguards tested
- Prospective upgrade paths defined

---

### Phase 3 — Small-Scale User Validation
- Onboard a limited number of informed users
- Operate across multiple execution cycles
- Monitor stability, clarity, and user understanding
- Refine documentation and support processes

**Exit Criteria:**
- Sustained correct operation over extended periods
- No systemic failures or user harm
- Users demonstrate clear understanding of system behavior

---

### Phase 4 — Gradual Expansion and Maturation
- Incrementally expand availability
- Introduce additional supported modules cautiously
- Continue security review and operational hardening
- Reduce founder involvement as operators mature

**Exit Criteria:**
- System operates reliably with minimal intervention
- Governance and operations function independently
- Growth remains aligned with design constraints

---

## 13.2 Validation Criteria

Validation at each phase is based on:
- Deterministic adherence to authorized parameters
- Accurate settlement and accounting
- Absence of discretionary behavior
- Clear user consent and responsibility
- No unresolved security or legal concerns

Advancement between phases occurs only when validation criteria are met.

---

## 13.3 Long-Term Evolution

Long-term evolution of YieldLoop prioritizes:
- Stability over expansion
- Constraint preservation over feature accumulation
- Trust compounding over market positioning

Future changes apply prospectively, are documented in advance, and do not alter settled outcomes. YieldLoop does not commit to a fixed feature roadmap and reserves the right to decline expansion that would compromise system integrity.
