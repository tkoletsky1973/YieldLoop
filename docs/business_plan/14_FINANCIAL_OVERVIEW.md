# 14. Financial Overview

YieldLoop’s financial design is intentionally conservative and constraint-driven. The system is built to prioritize correctness, security, and legal defensibility over growth, scale, or revenue maximization.

This section consolidates all financial considerations relevant to the project, including capital requirements, operating costs, revenue mechanics, funding sources, and sustainability assumptions.

This is not a forecast or projection. It is a description of how the business is funded, how it earns money, and how it remains viable under realistic conditions.

## 14.1 Financial Design Principles

YieldLoop’s financial model is governed by the following principles:

- Capital formation is distinct from operating revenue
- Revenue is a byproduct of correct execution, not a target
- No revenue mechanism may influence execution behavior
- The business must remain viable at small scale
- Flat or zero-revenue periods are expected and acceptable
- Growth is not a financial requirement

These principles are enforced by both architecture and policy.

---

## 14.2 Capital Requirements and Target Raise

YieldLoop’s initial capital target is:

**$120,000 – $150,000 USD (total)**

This range is designed to fully fund:
- Secure system development
- Independent security review
- Legal and administrative setup
- Conservative marketing and documentation
- Initial operational runway

The project is designed to remain viable at the lower end of this range.

## 14.3 Budget and Use of Funds

### A. Development and Security — **$40,000**

| Category | Estimated Cost |
|-------|---------------|
| Smart contract development | $20,000 |
| Backend / infrastructure tooling | $5,000 |
| Testing, simulations, and QA | $5,000 |
| Independent security audit | $10,000 |
| **Subtotal** | **$40,000** |

Security review is non-optional and treated as a core requirement rather than a discretionary expense.

### B. Marketing, Documentation, and Outreach — **$40,000**

| Category | Estimated Cost |
|-------|---------------|
| Documentation, diagrams, UX clarity | $10,000 |
| Website, branding, content | $10,000 |
| Community tooling and support | $5,000 |
| Conservative outreach and awareness | $10,000 |
| Contingency | $5,000 |
| **Subtotal** | **$40,000** |

Marketing spend explicitly excludes:
- Performance claims
- Influencer marketing
- Incentive-driven acquisition

---

### C. Legal, Administrative, and Insurance — **$30,000 – $40,000**

| Category | Estimated Cost |
|-------|---------------|
| LLC formation and maintenance | $2,000 |
| Legal review and advisory | $10,000 – $15,000 |
| Insurance (D&O, E&O, cyber) | $5,000 – $8,000 |
| Accounting and bookkeeping | $3,000 – $5,000 |
| Compliance and professional services | $5,000 |
| Infrastructure and admin overhead | $5,000 |
| **Subtotal** | **$30,000 – $40,000** |

Insurance is treated as a safety requirement, not optional overhead.

---

### D. Reserve and Runway — **$10,000 – $20,000**

Reserved for:
- Unexpected audit findings
- Regulatory or compliance changes
- Infrastructure scaling needs
- Operational continuity

---

### Total Budget Summary

| Category | Amount |
|------|-------|
| Development & Security | $40,000 |
| Marketing & Documentation | $40,000 |
| Legal & Admin | $30,000 – $40,000 |
| Reserve | $10,000 – $20,000 |
| **Total** | **$120,000 – $150,000** |

## 14.4 Capital Formation (How the Project Is Funded)

YieldLoop distinguishes clearly between **capital formation** and **operating revenue**.

### Primary Capital Formation: NFTs

NFTs are used as a **funding mechanism**, not as investment instruments.

NFTs:
- Do not represent equity
- Do not promise returns
- Do not grant yield or profit rights
- Do not influence execution behavior
- Provide access, discounts, or participation features only

NFT funding is preferred because it:
- Preserves founder control
- Avoids equity dilution
- Aligns with the ecosystem
- Allows gradual, organic funding

---

### Supplemental Capital Sources

YieldLoop may also pursue:
- Grants (infrastructure, security, open-source, research)
- Non-dilutive ecosystem funding
- Strategic partnerships
- Conservative loans or credit facilities, where appropriate

No funding source may impose:
- Growth mandates
- Revenue targets
- Execution influence
- Architectural compromise

---

## 14.5 Operating Revenue Model (How the Business Earns)

YieldLoop has **one** source of recurring operating revenue.

### Protocol Fee Revenue

Operating revenue is generated through a protocol fee applied to completed execution cycles that result in a net positive outcome.

Key characteristics:

- Fees are applied **only after execution is complete**
- Fees are applied **only if the settled outcome is positive**
- No fees are charged on:
  - Deposits
  - Withdrawals
  - Principal
  - In-progress execution
- Fee calculation is deterministic and based on finalized accounting
- If a cycle produces no net positive outcome, **no revenue is generated**

Revenue is therefore:
- Irregular
- Non-predictive
- Non-smoothable
- Directly tied to verified outcomes

---

### Referral Credits and Net Revenue

Referral credits, where applicable, are treated as a **marketing expense** offset against protocol fee revenue.

- Credits are sourced from protocol fees
- Credits are time-limited and capped
- Credits do not create ongoing obligations
- Credits do not alter execution behavior

Referral programs reduce net revenue but do not affect gross revenue mechanics.

---

## 14.6 Relationship Between Revenue and Scale

YieldLoop is designed to remain viable with:
- A small number of users
- Modest execution activity
- Intermittent or uneven revenue

The business does not require:
- Minimum TVL
- Continuous inflows
- Revenue growth targets

As usage increases, revenue may increase proportionally, but the business does not assume or depend on this outcome.

---

## 14.7 Sustainability Without Projections

YieldLoop does not publish revenue forecasts, return expectations, or growth projections.

Sustainability is defined as:
- Ability to maintain secure operation
- Ability to fund audits and maintenance
- Ability to operate without compromising constraints

Financial decisions are made to preserve system integrity rather than maximize revenue.

---

## Closing Statement

YieldLoop’s financial model is intentionally restrained.

Capital exists to support correctness, security, and longevity. Revenue exists as a consequence of correct execution, not as a driver of behavior. The business is structured to remain viable even when growth is slow, revenue is uneven, or attention is minimal.
