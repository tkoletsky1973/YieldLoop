# 8. Business Model

YieldLoop is operated as a constrained software infrastructure business. Its business model is intentionally limited to avoid conflicts of interest between system execution and revenue generation.

Revenue is derived solely from completed execution activity and is applied only after outcomes are finalized. The system does not monetize custody, deposits, user data, or participation itself.

---

## 8.1 Revenue Sources

YieldLoop generates revenue exclusively through protocol fees applied to completed execution cycles that result in a net positive outcome.

The system does not generate revenue from:
- Deposits or withdrawals
- Principal balances
- Unrealized activity
- Strategy selection or configuration
- Access to system features
- Sale of user or execution data

Optional ecosystem programs, such as NFTs or referral coordination, may provide supplemental, non-recurring funding. These programs are operationally separate from execution activity and do not influence system behavior, settlement, or accounting.

---

## 8.2 Fee Application and Timing

Protocol fees are applied only when all of the following conditions are met:

1. An execution cycle has fully completed
2. Settlement and accounting are finalized
3. The ending vault state exceeds the starting vault state after all execution-related costs

Fees are calculated as a percentage of the net positive outcome for the cycle. If no net positive outcome exists, no protocol fee is charged.

Fee calculation is deterministic and based solely on finalized accounting records. Fees are not estimated, reserved, or collected in advance and do not influence execution behavior.

## 8.3 Sustainability Assumptions

YieldLoop’s sustainability model assumes:
- Modest, steady system usage rather than rapid growth
- Gradual operational efficiency improvements over time
- Conservative cost management
- No reliance on token emissions, leverage, or external subsidies

The system is designed to remain operable at small scale and to improve resilience as usage grows. Fee schedules may adjust prospectively to reflect operational scale, but do not create user expectations or incentives tied to aggregate behavior.

YieldLoop does not assume continuous growth, market dominance, or network effects to remain viable. Sustainability is derived from disciplined operation and alignment between system behavior and business incentives.

## 8.4 Relationship to Financial Sustainability

YieldLoop’s business model is designed to support long-term sustainability without reliance on growth assumptions or performance projections.

All revenue mechanics, budget assumptions, and funding structures are described in Section 14. This section defines the constraints and intent of the model, while Section 14 defines how capital is raised, how operating revenue is generated, and how costs are managed.
