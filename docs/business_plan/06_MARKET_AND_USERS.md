# 6. Market and Users

YieldLoop is not designed for broad consumer adoption or speculative mass-market use. It is intentionally built for a narrow set of users who value determinism, explicit authorization, and post-execution accounting over convenience, optimization, or performance narratives.

This section defines who YieldLoop is for, who it is not for, and the realistic scope of its addressable market.

## 6.1 Target Users

YieldLoop’s primary users share the following characteristics:

- They retain custody of their own digital assets
- They are comfortable authorizing explicit execution rules
- They understand that execution outcomes may include loss
- They prefer auditability and clarity over automation convenience
- They do not rely on projections, dashboards, or implied performance

Examples of target user profiles include:

- Technically literate individual users seeking non-custodial execution
- Builders, engineers, or operators testing deterministic strategies
- Small funds, DAOs, or entities requiring explicit authorization boundaries
- Early institutional or professional users evaluating infrastructure primitives

YieldLoop is appropriate for users who are willing to trade immediacy and simplicity for control and clarity.

## 6.2 Non-Target Users

YieldLoop is explicitly not designed for users who:

- Expect guaranteed returns or consistent yield
- Prefer fully managed or discretionary systems
- Rely on real-time performance indicators or signals
- Are unwilling to accept execution or smart contract risk
- Seek simplified “set and forget” financial products

The system does not attempt to accommodate these users, as doing so would require compromises that conflict with its core design principles.

## 6.3 Realistic Market Scope

YieldLoop’s addressable market is intentionally narrow in its early stages.

Initial success is defined not by user count or total assets, but by sustained, correct operation with a small number of informed users over extended periods. Validation may occur with tens or hundreds of users rather than thousands.

Over time, the system may appeal to a broader audience as regulatory scrutiny increases and demand for transparent, non-discretionary infrastructure grows. Any expansion is expected to occur gradually and organically rather than through aggressive user acquisition strategies.

YieldLoop’s market strategy prioritizes durability and trust over scale.
