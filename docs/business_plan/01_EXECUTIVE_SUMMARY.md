# 1. Executive Summary

YieldLoop is a deterministic, user-authorized execution infrastructure designed to operate on digital assets without custody, discretion, pooling, or implied performance.

The system enables users to explicitly authorize predefined actions on their own assets for bounded execution cycles and records the outcomes of those actions only after execution has completed. YieldLoop does not forecast results, optimize strategies, or provide investment advice. It exists to execute what users authorize and to account for what actually occurs.

YieldLoop is intentionally designed as infrastructure, not a financial product. Assets remain in user-owned vaults at all times. The system cannot act without explicit, time-bounded authorization and cannot modify behavior mid-cycle. Execution, settlement, and accounting are separated into discrete, enforced stages to prevent ambiguity, misinterpretation, or reliance on projected outcomes.

The core problem YieldLoop addresses is not the absence of yield opportunities, but the structural ambiguity present in many existing systems. Users are frequently exposed to implied promises, discretionary behavior, opaque accounting, real-time performance signaling, and incentive conflicts that obscure what is actually happening to their assets. YieldLoop removes these ambiguities by design.

Revenue is generated solely through protocol fees applied after settlement and only when a completed execution cycle results in a net positive outcome. No fees are charged on deposits, withdrawals, principal, or unrealized activity. The business model is intentionally constrained to avoid conflicts between execution behavior and revenue generation.

YieldLoop is not designed for mass-market speculation or rapid user acquisition. Early success is defined as correctness, safety, and sustained operability with a small number of informed users over extended periods. The system is expected to validate slowly, mature quietly, and grow organically based on trust rather than promotion.

This business plan describes how YieldLoop operates as a business while preserving the architectural and ethical constraints defined in the technical whitepaper. It addresses organizational structure, governance posture, regulatory considerations, operational execution, and long-term sustainability without reliance on growth assumptions or performance narratives.
