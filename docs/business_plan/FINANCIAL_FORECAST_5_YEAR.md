# YieldLoop — 5-Year Financial Forecast  
**Low & Base Scenarios | AUM-Based Sliding Fee Model**

This document provides a conservative, bank-credible financial forecast for the YieldLoop platform over a five-year horizon.

The forecast reflects:
- A deterministic, user-favorable **AUM-based sliding fee model**
- No founder salary
- Conservative profit assumptions
- Multiple revenue sources
- Explicit exclusion of speculative or unrealized gains

This forecast is designed for:
- Banks and lenders
- Grant committees
- Strategic partners
- Internal planning and governance

## 1) Platform Fee Model (Authoritative)

YieldLoop charges a performance-based platform fee on **verified net profit only**.

### Sliding Fee Rule
- Initial platform fee: **20%**
- For every **$1,000,000 of total AUM**, the platform fee is reduced by **0.5%**
- Fee reduction continues until:
  - **$20,000,000 AUM**
  - **10% platform fee**
- At 10%, the fee is **locked** and no longer decreases

### Fee Formula

Effective Fee (%) = max(10%, 20% − (AUM in millions × 0.5%))


This structure:
- Rewards scale
- Aligns platform incentives with users
- Provides deterministic, auditable fee behavior
- Improves long-term regulatory optics
