# 3. Problem Statement

The primary problem YieldLoop addresses is not a lack of financial opportunity, yield availability, or automation tooling. The problem is **structural ambiguity** in how many systems execute actions on user assets and represent outcomes.

Across much of the digital asset ecosystem, users are exposed to systems that blur or collapse critical boundaries between authorization, execution, outcome measurement, and representation. This ambiguity creates misaligned incentives, user misunderstanding, regulatory risk, and hidden exposure that persists even in systems that appear technically sophisticated.

## 3.1 Market Failures and User Risk

Many existing platforms exhibit one or more of the following structural failures:

- **Implied outcomes** presented through projections, estimated APYs, real-time dashboards, or forward-looking metrics
- **Discretionary execution**, where systems adapt, intervene, or alter behavior without renewed user authorization
- **Opaque accounting**, where outcomes are smoothed, offset across periods, or represented before execution has fully concluded
- **Custodial or pooled structures** that obscure asset ownership and control boundaries
- **Incentive conflicts**, where execution behavior is influenced by fee optimization, growth pressure, or token incentives

These patterns expose users to risks they may not fully understand, including execution risk, accounting misinterpretation, and reliance on system behavior that is not explicitly authorized or auditable.

Even when losses do not occur, ambiguity itself creates risk by encouraging assumptions about system behavior, responsibility, and expected outcomes.

## 3.2 Limitations of Existing Solutions

Existing solutions generally attempt to address these issues through additional disclosures, disclaimers, analytics, or user education. These approaches treat ambiguity as a communication problem rather than a structural one.

Common limitations include:

- Reliance on disclosures instead of architectural enforcement
- Use of real-time metrics that imply performance before execution completes
- Post-hoc explanations that cannot be independently verified
- Complex incentive structures that obscure responsibility and accountability
- Regul
