# 2. Company Overview

YieldLoop is operated as a software infrastructure project focused on deterministic execution, explicit authorization, and post-execution outcome accounting for digital assets.

The company exists to design, operate, and maintain the YieldLoop system in a manner that prioritizes security, legal defensibility, and long-term operability over growth, scale, or market visibility.

YieldLoop is not structured or operated as a financial services provider, investment manager, broker, or custodian. Its business activities are limited to software development, system operation, maintenance, and support of user-authorized execution infrastructure.

## 2.1 Legal Structure and Jurisdiction

YieldLoop is intended to operate through a formally registered legal entity appropriate for software infrastructure development. Jurisdictional selection is guided by regulatory clarity, operational practicality, and legal defensibility rather than tax optimization or regulatory arbitrage.

The entity does not take custody of user assets, does not pool funds, and does not exercise discretionary control over execution. All system actions occur only within the scope of explicit, time-bounded user authorization.

Any future changes to legal structure or jurisdiction apply prospectively and do not alter system behavior, user ownership, or settled outcomes.

## 2.2 Mission and Design Philosophy

The mission of YieldLoop is to provide a system that executes exactly what users authorize and records exactly what occurs — nothing more and nothing less.

The project is guided by the following principles:

- User assets remain under user control at all times
- Authorization is explicit, bounded, and revocable between cycles
- Execution behavior is deterministic and rule-based
- Outcomes are recorded only after execution completes
- No promises, projections, or implied performance are presented
- Legal and ethical restraint is favored over growth incentives

YieldLoop is intentionally designed to avoid features or behaviors that could create reliance, misinterpretation, or conflicts of interest between the system and its users.

## 2.3 Governance and Ownership Posture

YieldLoop is founder-led with delegated execution authority.

Strategic vision, architectural direction, and final veto authority over high-impact decisions remain with the founder in a steward or architect role. Day-to-day operations, development, and administration are intended to be handled by qualified operators acting within clearly defined authority boundaries.

Governance exists to preserve system integrity, security, and legal defensibility. It does not direct execution behavior, influence user outcomes, or override user authorization.

Ownership and control structures are designed to prevent external parties from forcing changes that would compromise system safety, legality, or user trust.

The founder’s role is expected to diminish over time as the system stabilizes, while retaining high-level oversight and veto authority for consequential changes.
