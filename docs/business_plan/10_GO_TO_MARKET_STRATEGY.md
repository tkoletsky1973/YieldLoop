# 10. Go-To-Market Strategy

YieldLoop does not pursue rapid user acquisition, viral growth, or speculative adoption. Its go-to-market strategy is intentionally conservative and validation-driven, prioritizing correctness, safety, and sustained operation over scale.

The system is designed to earn trust through behavior over time rather than persuasion at launch.

---

## 10.1 Early Validation Strategy

Initial adoption is expected to occur through a small number of informed users who understand the system’s constraints and are willing to engage with it over extended periods.

Early validation focuses on:
- Correct execution within authorized bounds
- Accurate settlement and accounting
- Stable operation across multiple execution cycles
- Clear user understanding of system behavior and limitations

Success in early stages is measured by system correctness and user retention, not by deposit volume or user count.

## 10.2 Growth Constraints and Intentional Limits

YieldLoop imposes deliberate constraints on growth to preserve system integrity and reduce risk.

These constraints include:
- No incentive-based onboarding or referral-driven acceleration
- No promotional claims regarding yield, performance, or outcomes
- No prioritization of execution based on deposit size
- No paid acquisition campaigns targeting retail users

Growth is expected to occur organically as users gain confidence in the system’s behavior and reliability.

## 10.3 What YieldLoop Will Not Do to Grow

YieldLoop explicitly avoids the following common growth tactics:

- Performance-based marketing or implied return narratives
- Token emissions or reward schemes tied to participation
- Gamification of execution outcomes
- Influencer-driven promotion
- Urgency-based onboarding or limited-time incentives

These tactics are avoided because they introduce misaligned incentives, increase regulatory risk, and undermine user understanding of system boundaries.

The go-to-market strategy is designed to align with the system’s architectural constraints and long-term operability rather than short-term adoption metrics.

Marketing activities are limited to education, documentation, tooling, and awareness, and explicitly exclude performance promotion, incentives, or yield-driven acquisition.
