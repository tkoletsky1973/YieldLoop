# YieldLoop Business Plan
## A Deterministic, User-Authorized Execution Infrastructure
### Version 1.0 — Working Draft

---

## Purpose of This Document

This business plan describes the **organizational, operational, legal, and commercial framework** for the YieldLoop system.

It exists to explain:
- Why YieldLoop exists as a business
- How it operates sustainably without compromising its design principles
- How responsibilities, authority, and risk are allocated
- How the system is positioned relative to users, regulators, and partners

This document is **not** a marketing pitch and does not replace the YieldLoop whitepaper.  
It is intended to complement the technical specification by addressing execution, governance, and business realities.

Section 14 provides a consolidated financial model including budget, funding strategy, and operating revenue mechanics.

---

## Relationship to Other Documentation

This business plan should be read alongside:

- `/docs/whitepaper/Whitepaper.md`  
  (Technical system design and execution rules)

- `/docs/whitepaper/REGULATORY_POSITION.md`  
  (Design intent and regulatory posture)

- `/docs/appendices/`  
  (NFT programs, governance, referrals, and other optional ecosystem components)

Where conflicts appear, **the whitepaper governs system behavior**, and this document governs **business intent and operations**.

---

## Design Principles

The YieldLoop business is governed by the same principles as the system itself:

- Explicit authorization over implied consent
- Deterministic execution over discretionary behavior
- Outcome recording over performance projection
- Legal and ethical restraint over growth incentives
- Long-term operability over short-term scale

The business model is intentionally constrained to preserve system integrity, user safety, and regulatory defensibility.

---

## Intended Audience

This document is written for:
- Operators and internal stakeholders
- Advisors and professional service providers
- Grant reviewers and infrastructure partners
- Regulators or institutional counterparties seeking clarity

It is **not** written for retail marketing or speculative promotion.
