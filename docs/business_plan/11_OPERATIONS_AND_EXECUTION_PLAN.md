# 11. Operations and Execution Plan

YieldLoop is designed to operate with clear separation between strategic oversight and day-to-day execution. Operational structure is intentionally defined to reduce founder bottlenecks, prevent discretionary drift, and preserve system integrity over time.

This section describes how YieldLoop is operated, how decisions are made, and how authority is distributed.

---

## 11.1 Organizational Structure

YieldLoop is operated as a lean, modular organization focused on software development, security, and operational reliability.

Core operational functions may include:
- Engineering and system development
- Infrastructure and deployment management
- Security review and incident response
- Administrative and compliance coordination
- User support and documentation

Day-to-day execution is intended to be handled by qualified operators with clearly defined roles and authority. Responsibilities are assigned based on function rather than title, and operational authority is constrained by documented processes.

## 11.2 Founder Role and Authority Boundaries

The founder serves in a **steward and architectural oversight role**, not as a day-to-day operator.

Founder responsibilities include:
- Defining and maintaining system design principles
- Providing architectural guidance and long-term vision
- Participating in the selection of key operators and advisors
- Exercising veto authority over high-impact or system-altering decisions

The founder does not:
- Direct daily operations
- Intervene in routine execution decisions
- Manage individual users or execution cycles
- Override settled outcomes or user authorization

This role is designed to preserve continuity and integrity while allowing professional operators to manage execution efficiently.

## 11.3 Decision-Making and Reporting Cadence

YieldLoop operates with a structured reporting and decision cadence to maintain transparency without micromanagement.

Operational reporting includes:
- A start-of-week status report outlining planned work and priorities
- An end-of-week report summarizing completed work, issues, and risks
- Exception-based escalation for security, legal, or system integrity concerns

The founder reviews reports and may request deeper review of specific areas as needed. Input is provided through consultation rather than directive control, except in cases involving security, legality, or fundamental system changes.

Routine decisions are delegated. Only consequential decisions require founder involvement.

---

## 11.4 Referral Program Operations (Clarification)

YieldLoop maintains a limited referral coordination program governed separately from go-to-market strategy.

Referral credits:
- Are accounted for as promotional or marketing expense
- Are sourced exclusively from protocol fees after settlement
- Do not affect user principal or execution behavior
- Are time-bounded and capped
- Do not create ongoing compensation relationships

The referral program does not function as a growth engine and does not influence operational priorities, execution logic, or system behavior.

---

## 11.5 Financial Authority and Spend Controls

Financial decisions are governed by budget categories and milestone-based spending rather than discretionary allocation.

Use of funds is constrained to approved budget categories as defined in Section 14. Material deviations, reallocation between categories, or unplanned expenditures require founder review and approval.

This structure ensures that financial decisions do not compromise system integrity, security priorities, or legal posture.
