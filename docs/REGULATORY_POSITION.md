# YieldLoop — Regulatory Position and Design Intent

This document explains the **regulatory posture, design intent, and boundary conditions** of the YieldLoop platform.

It is not legal advice. It exists to provide clarity to reviewers, auditors, partners, and developers regarding how YieldLoop is structured and why specific design decisions were made.

---

## 1) Design Intent

YieldLoop is designed as a **non-custodial, proof-driven DeFi platform** focused on verifying real surplus rather than projecting returns.

Key intent:
- Avoid representations of guaranteed yield
- Avoid inflationary or synthetic reward mechanisms
- Avoid implied ownership, equity, or profit participation
- Maintain explicit administrative accountability

The platform favors **clarity and verifiability** over aggressive decentralization or marketing claims.

---

## 2) No Investment Offering

YieldLoop does **not** offer:
- Equity
- Revenue share
- Profit participation
- Guaranteed or expected returns
- Interest-bearing instruments

Nothing in the protocol, NFTs, documentation, or UI constitutes:
- An offer of securities
- An investment contract
- Financial advice

Users interact with the platform voluntarily and at their own risk.

---

## 3) Utility NFT Position

YieldLoop NFTs are **utility and role tokens**, not financial instruments.

### Supporter NFT
- Provides operational protocol-fee discounts
- Grants access to community channels
- Is transferable
- Does not generate yield or profit

### Governor NFT
- Represents an advisory/support role
- Is bestowed, not sold by default
- Is non-transferable by default
- Does not grant governance authority or ownership

NFTs:
- Do not entitle holders to profit
- Do not influence execution outcomes
- Do not represent an expectation of appreciation

---

## 4) Discounts Are Operational, Not Financial Returns

Protocol-fee discounts:
- Reduce platform fees only
- Are applied at settlement
- Do not increase gross returns
- Do not eliminate losses

Discounts are operational incentives, not financial rewards.

---

## 5) Advisory vs Governance Separation

YieldLoop deliberately separates **advisory participation** from **binding governance authority**.

- Advisory input is non-binding
- Governance actions are executed by a multisig
- No NFT holder has unilateral control

This structure avoids:
- Implied fiduciary duties
- Unclear accountability
- Premature decentralization risks

---

## 6) Governor Support Bounties

Governor support bounties:
- Are discretionary
- Are paid in LOOP
- Are funded exclusively from the **marketing budget**
- Represent **0.5%–1.0% of the total marketing budget**
- Are not guaranteed
- Are not yield or profit share

These bounties are operational support allocations, not compensation or investment returns.

---

## 7) Administrative Control and Accountability

Administrative actions are:
- Explicit
- On-chain
- Controlled by multisig
- Logged via events

There is no hidden or implicit governance.

Centralized control at launch is intentional to:
- Reduce systemic risk
- Enable accountability
- Simplify audits and reviews

---

## 8) No Custody Representation

YieldLoop does not custody user funds beyond what is required for smart contract execution.

- Users interact via their own wallets
- Private keys are never accessed or stored
- Users retain control subject to contract logic

---

## 9) Risk Disclosure

YieldLoop is experimental software.

Risks include:
- Smart contract risk
- Market risk
- Liquidity risk
- Execution risk
- Regulatory uncertainty

Users must evaluate these risks independently.

---

## 10) Future Changes

YieldLoop may evolve over time.

Future changes may include:
- New strategies
- Additional NFTs or roles
- Governance experiments
- UI enhancements

No future rights, benefits, or returns are implied by current participation.

---

## 11) Summary

YieldLoop is designed to:
- Measure reality, not promise outcomes
- Provide utility without implying profit
- Encourage advisory participation without ceding control
- Maintain clear, auditable boundaries

This document exists to make those boundaries explicit.
