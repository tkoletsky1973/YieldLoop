# YieldLoop

**YieldLoop** is a non-custodial, cycle-based execution and settlement protocol designed to measure and record only completed, verifiable outcomes.

The system is built around a single governing rule:

**If an outcome cannot be verified after execution, it does not exist.**

YieldLoop does not display projected returns, estimated yields, or interim performance metrics. All outcomes are evaluated only after execution has concluded and settlement is finalized.

---

## Purpose

YieldLoop exists to provide infrastructure for:
- User-authorized strategy execution
- Deterministic enforcement of execution constraints
- Post-execution verification and accounting
- Transparent settlement of completed outcomes

The protocol prioritizes clarity, auditability, and rule enforcement over flexibility, speed, or optimization.

## What YieldLoop Is

YieldLoop is:
- A **non-custodial protocol** using user-owned smart contract vaults
- A **cycle-based system** with fixed execution and settlement boundaries
- A **rules-driven execution framework** without discretionary control
- A **post-execution accounting mechanism** that records only finalized results
- Infrastructure intended to be verifiable by independent observers

---

## What YieldLoop Is Not

YieldLoop is not:
- An investment product
- A managed fund
- A trading advisor or portfolio manager
- A yield optimizer or aggregator
- A forecasting or performance prediction system

YieldLoop does not custody assets, pool funds, recommend strategies, or guarantee outcomes.

## Execution Model

Execution occurs only within explicitly defined cycles.  
Each cycle follows a fixed sequence:
1. User configuration and authorization
2. Active execution under enforced constraints
3. Settlement and verification
4. Post-cycle user decision

During an active execution cycle, withdrawals and parameter changes are disabled. Users regain full control only after settlement completes.

No execution occurs without explicit user authorization.

---

## Outcomes and Fees

Outcomes are evaluated retrospectively.  
Only completed execution results are recognized.

Protocol fees apply only to verified surplus after all execution-related costs have been deducted. No fees are charged on deposits, principal, or cycles that do not result in a verified positive outcome.

Fee logic, limits, and governance constraints are defined explicitly in the protocol specification.

---

## Ecosystem Programs

YieldLoop may support optional ecosystem programs such as NFTs, referral initiatives, or advisory participation.

These programs:
- Are not required to use the protocol
- Do not alter execution or settlement behavior
- Do not represent ownership, profit-sharing, or revenue rights
- Are defined separately from core protocol logic

Operational details for such programs are subject to change and do not form part of the core protocol definition.
